# Virtual-Instrument-Diagrams

This repository is the home of the different diagrams used in the construction of our instrument simulators!

All graphics were created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

## Notes

The following sections will further explain information that new programmers to the project may not be familiar with.

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics

Raster graphics are based off a matrix (bitmap) of pixels. As expanded (zoomed or stretched) the fixed number of pixels are expanded, losing detail. Vector graphics use mathematical formulas instead, allowing for the image to never lose resolution.

### Inkscape Tutorials

Like any graphics editing software, Inkscape has many icons with little description of what it does. Here are some videos I found that expose me to the Inkscape's tools.
